# Day 7 – Internal CSS & Semantic HTML

# Overview:
On Day 7, I practiced embedding CSS styles directly into an HTML page and explored how to use different selectors, direction attributes, and styling techniques to format content.

# Key Features:
- ✅ Used `<style>` tag inside `<head>` to define styles for:
  - ID selectors (`#heading`, `#head`)
  - Class selector (`.para`)
- 🎨 Applied styles: color, background-color, and custom font
- 🌐 Demonstrated `dir="rtl"` for right-to-left text layout
- 🧠 Used `title` attribute to show tooltips on hover

# Learning Outcomes:
- Difference between inline, internal, and external CSS
- How to target elements using ID and Class
- How to use semantic HTML tags effectively with style

# Next Steps:
- Explore external CSS
- Add hover effects, transitions, and media queries
- Combine with JavaScript for interactivity
